            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I am a student at Lindenwood University, and this site is dedicated to my work in <strong>ENGL 170: First-Year Writing</strong> for the Spring 2026 semester.</p>
            
            <p>In this course, we are exploring the relationship between AI, writing, and intellectual work. This blog will serve as a digital journal where I post three times a week to reflect on these topics and engage with the ideas of my classmates.</p>
            
            <p>My goal for this semester is to better understand how technology influences the way we think and communicate.</p>
